# Firefox code coverage history viewer prototype
This is a repository to prototype a code coverage history viewer for Firefox.

The scope of this project is minimal as it will focus on a similar view as the [commits view](https://codecov.io/gh/marco-c/gecko-dev/commits) of codecov.io.
This is to support this [code coverage planning document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dOWi18qrudwaOThNAYoCMS3e9LzhxGUiMLLrQ_WVR9w/edit#heading=h.rj6a3f39527l).

You can preview the current app [here](https://armenzg.github.io/code_cov_experiments/).
